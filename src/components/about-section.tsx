        I'm a software developer who genuinely loves what I do â€“ building apps that actually work well and solving tricky problems that keep me up at night (in a good way). I work across the full stack, from making interfaces that don't frustrate users to backend systems that don't crash when things get busy. At the end of the day, I just want to build stuff that people find useful and that I can be proud of.
